# Subnetting
A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.

## Key Terminologies
* Subnet mask -A subnet mask is like an IP address, but for only internal usage within a network.





## Exercise 
- Create a network architecture that meets the following requirements:
1 private subnet accessible only from within the LAN. This subnet must be able to accommodate a minimum of 15 hosts.
1 private subnet that has Internet access through a NAT gateway. This subnet must be able to accommodate a minimum of 30 hosts (the 30 hosts does not include the NAT gateway).
1 public subnet with an internet gateway. This subnet must be able to accommodate a minimum of 5 hosts (the 5 hosts does not include the internet gateway).
- Post the architecture you created including a brief explanation in the Github repository you shared with the learning coach.

### Overcome challenges

 Understanding the subnetting topic and drawing the network diagram was a little challenging and took more time than expected. The diagram also had to be drawn many times as i missed to see the template given in the question.

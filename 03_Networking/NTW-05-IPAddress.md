### Overcome challenges
 The changing of Ip address on phone was a little challenging as the results wasnt seen when the IP address alone was changed.The gateway and ip address change was only able to make a difference in the results and the understanding of the results.

 ### Results

#### Question 1

Public address of both laptop and phone are same. The public address is the address that you receive for your router from the Internet service provider,which is used when you access the internet. So it will be same for allthe devices connected to your home router.

#### Question 2

Private ip address are different for laptop and mobile phone.These addresses are basically assigned by the network router to your particular device. The unique private IP address is provided to every device which is on the same network.

#### Question 3

When ip address of the mobile was changed to that of the laptop it was connecting to the network .

#### Question 4

When ip address of the mobile was changed to outside of your network it wont be able to connect to the network. As the public ip address is changed and the gateway address is also changed this makes it impossible for the mobile phone to access the internet.
